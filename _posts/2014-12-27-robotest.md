I've been using Scala to create Android applications for some time now, and I've always been using ScalaTest for testing my Scala code. It felt perfectly natural that I wanted to test Android application the same way.
When it comes to testing of Android applications, [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) is the main library for the job. Unfortunately it only comes with JUnit support, and using it from ScalaTest is only possible with some serious plumbing.
Some time ago I decided to extract all this plumbing, update it to latest Robolectric release, and publish it as separate project: [RoboTest](https://github.com/zbsz/robotest).


### Writing tests
To use Robolectric in your tests just add `RobolectricSuite` mixin to your test, make sure to add it as the last trait in class declaration.

```scala
class SampleRoboSpec extends FeatureSpec with RobolectricSuite {
  ...
}
```

It should be possible to use any testing style supported by ScalaTest, lifecycle traits like `BeforAndAfter` and `BeforeAndAfterAll` are also supported.

Here is sample test using shared database for all tests:

```scala 
class DatabaseRoboSpec extends FeatureSpec 
    with Matchers with BeforeAndAfter with BeforeAndAfterAll with RobolectricSuite {

  var helper: SQLiteOpenHelper = _
  var db: SQLiteDatabase = _

  override protected def beforeAll(): Unit = {
    helper = new SQLiteOpenHelper(Robolectric.application, "test", null, 1) {
      override def onUpgrade(db: SQLiteDatabase, oldVersion: Int, newVersion: Int): Unit = {}
      override def onCreate(db: SQLiteDatabase): Unit = {}
    }
  }

  override protected def afterAll(): Unit = {
    Robolectric.application.getDatabasePath(helper.getDatabaseName).delete()
  }

  before {
    db = helper.getWritableDatabase
    db.execSQL("CREATE TABLE Test(_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);")
  }

  after {
    db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Test;")
    db.close()
  }

  feature("Robolectric test using database") {

    scenario("Insert row") {
      val values = new ContentValues()
      values.put("_id", Integer.valueOf(1))
      values.put("value", "test")

      db.insert("Test", null, values) shouldEqual 1
    }

    scenario("Query all rows from empty table") {

      val cursor = db.query("Test", null, null, null, null, null, null)
      cursor.moveToFirst() shouldEqual false
      cursor.getCount shouldEqual 0
    }
  }
}
```
