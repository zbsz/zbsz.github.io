I've been using Scala to create Android applications for some time now, and I've always been using ScalaTest for testing my Scala code. It felt perfectly natural that I wanted to test Android application the same way.
When it comes to testing of Android applications, Robolectric is the main library for the job. Unfortunately it only comes with JUnit support, and using it from ScalaTest is only possible with some serious plumbing.
Some time ago I decided to extract all this plumbing, update it to latest Robolectric release, and publish it as separate project: Robotest.
