To create reactive applications we need proper mechanisms, idea for [`Signal`](https://github.com/zbsz/geteit-utils/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/geteit/events/Signal.scala) 
is borrowed from FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). With couple additions to better support Android app lifecycle, signals become very powerful, yet simple,
building blocks for our apps. They are especially useful in UI development.

### What is Signal

In general, Signal is just a value that changes over time, and provides change notifications, a bit like `Observable`.
Very simplified signal interface provides methods to set and observe current value, it could look something like this:
 
```scala
trait Signal[T] {
  def set(value: T): Unit
  def subscribe(f: T => Unit): Unit
}
```

#### Cell in a spreadsheet

Signals are much more then just simple observable, they are composable.
In this regard, signals can be compared to cells in a spreadsheet, where value of one cell can be defined as a function taking inputs from other cells.

#### Signals and Reactive Streams

Signals may seem very similar to [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/), signal can be viewed as a stream of change events, 
and event stream could be converted into signal using `scan` operator.
But this comparison can be misleading, with signals, we don't really care about the events, we are only interested in current state. Actually, we 
are mostly interested in final state, after all changes are applied. This difference has significant implications in how signals can be used compared to event streams.

### Signal properties

signals contract

- subscribers will be notified with final value (eventually)
- signal is allowed to skip intermediate states
- signal is allowed to notify subscribers multiple times
  - notify on subscribe
  - notify on context resume
- subscriber can specify its execution context
- otherwise signal is processed synchronously
- signal can be empty
  - subscribers are not notified
- signals graph is eventually consistent
- signal api is thread safe

### Composing Signals


### Sample usage


### Signal lifecycle

- corresponds to lifecycle context
  - global
  - activity
  - fragment
  - view
- every subscribe is done in some context (usually implicit)
- subscribers will not be notified when context is not active
- automatic unsubscribe when context is destroyed

### Auto-wiring


### EventStream
